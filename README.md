## Summary Statistics

In R, we can calculate statistic measurements using libraries such as "DescTools" or "Agricolae". Also, you will see two plot with histogram and boxplot charts. In this repository, you have to find statistic measurements using two simple examples: Height of students of a school, and Number of books in several houses of a location. The statistic measurements calculated are:

#Central Tendency Measure:
    - Mean
    - Median
    - Mode

#Statistical Dispersion Measure:
    - Variance
    - Standard Deviation
    - Variance Coefficient

# Position Measure (Quantile):
    - Percentile
    - Quartile
    - Decile

#Asymmetric Measure:
    - Third Central Moment
    - fisher Asymmetry Coefficient (skewness)
    - Three Quartiles Based Index

#Tailedness Measure:
    - Kurtosis
